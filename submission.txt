In the Todo app
1 . Add a new attribute to the Todo model and update the views to display and
edit the new field. For practical purposes, letâ€™s say we want to add a new boolean field called
done with a default value of false

rails generate migration AddDoneToTodo done:boolean
rails db:migrate
Update todos_controller to include done attribute
Update _form.html.erb and _todo.html.erb views files

2. Change the routing schema. Suppose we want a new route new_todo to go to a page that
creates a new Todo item.


3. Set todos#index as the homepage for the app.

went to routes.rb
made todos#index the root to make it the homepage -> root "todos#index"
